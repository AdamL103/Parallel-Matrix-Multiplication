# Parallel-Matrix-Multiplication
Collaborative project in C. Compares the efficiency of process-based and thread-based parallel implementations to a serial implementation of matrix multiplicaiton by multiplying a 1024 x 1024 matrix using the three implementations. The program will print the elapsed time for each of the implementations.

NOTE: main.c was provided by our professor as a driver for our matrix_mult.c and matrix_mult.h. We did not create it.

Example of usage in Linux:

user:~$ make
user:~$ ./matrix_mult
